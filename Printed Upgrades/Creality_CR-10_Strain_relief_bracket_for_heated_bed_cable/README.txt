# Summary

This an accessory for the Creality CR-10 3D Printer.

**This bracket does not fit on the CR-10 Mini, if you own a Mini have a look to this bracket by Olesmokie https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2742895** 

The purpose of this bracket is to hold the wires for the heated bed in place to avoid that they wiggle when the bed move which would ultimately lead to breaking the welds or the wires.

The bracket is designed to be installed on the far left screw under the spring as shown on one of the picture. You will typically need to remove the glass bed for that.

The bracket does not touch the heated bed and can be safely printed in PLA. Reverse the cover upside down for printing.

Once the bracket is in place, move the wires a bit toward the bed (to avoid to put too much tension in them) and hold the wire in place with 2 zip ties.

**September 22nd, 2017 update**

This bracket is now factory installed by Creality3D themselves on their printers. This is with my full consent. Creality3D contacted me to ask if I would agree and very kindly offered me two free printers (CR10S & Ender 4) after I replied positively.
